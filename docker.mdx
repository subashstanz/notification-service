Explain all these statements in detail ?

I'll explain each part of this Docker Compose file in detail:
Version
'

- This specifies the Docker Compose file format version
  3.8 is a modern version that supports most current Docker features
  Services
  The file defines 3 services: redis, api, and worker. Let's break down each one:

1. Redis Service
   6379

- This sets up a Redis database server
  Port 6379 is Redis's default port
  The service will be accessible to other containers as 'redis'

2. API Service
   3000

- This is your main API service
  It's built from a local Dockerfile
  It depends on Redis being available
  Exposes port 3000 for API access

- This is a separate service that runs a worker
  It also depends on Redis
  It runs a different script (worker.js)
