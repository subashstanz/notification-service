Can you explain

What is queue vs task vs worker vs job?
I need a pratical explanation of this ?
Why is redis involved here ? isn't this presistent database ?

Let me explain these concepts with a real-world analogy: a restaurant kitchen!

Restaurant Kitchen Analogy
Queue (Redis) = Order Ticket Rail
Think of Redis like the metal rail where waiters clip order tickets
It holds all pending orders (tasks) that need to be prepared
Orders stay there until a chef (worker) takes them
Task/Job = Food Order
A single order ticket (like "1 burger, 2 fries")
In code: { type: "email", recipient: "user@example.com", message: "Your order is ready" }
Worker = Chef
The person (or multiple people) who processes the orders
Takes one order at a time from the rail
In our case: worker.js is like a chef

4. **Queue vs Job**

```javascript
// Waiter putting an order on the rail (Queue)
await notificationQueue.add({
  // Like clipping a ticket
  type: "email",
  recipient: "user@example.com",
  message: "Order confirmed!",
});

// Chef (Worker) processing orders
notificationWorker.process(async (job) => {
  // Like taking a ticket
  const { type, recipient, message } = job.data;
  // Prepare the order (send notification)
});
```

Redis is used here as a **message broker**, not primarily as a database. Here's why:

1. **Speed**: Redis is in-memory and super fast

   ```javascript
   // Adding to queue is instant
   await notificationQueue.add({ ... });  // Microseconds
   ```

2. **Persistence**: If the kitchen (worker) crashes

   ```javascript
   // Jobs remain in Redis even if worker crashes
   worker: restart: always; // Worker restarts and continues processing
   ```

3. **Distribution**: Multiple workers can grab jobs
   ```javascript
   // Like having multiple chefs
   worker1 = new Worker("notifications", ...);
   worker2 = new Worker("notifications", ...);  // Both take jobs from same queue
   ```

Why Use a Queue?
Speed: Don't make customers wait
Without queue: Customer waits while email sends (slow!)
With queue: Customer gets instant response
Reliability: Nothing gets lost
If email service is down, order stays in queue
Will retry automatically

Key Differences:
Queue = Storage
Holds pending tasks
Maintains order
Persists tasks if system crashes
Worker = Processor
Takes tasks from queue
Does the actual work
Can be scaled (multiple workers)

When Docker starts the worker container:
It runs worker.js
The notificationWorker connects to Redis
It automatically starts listening for jobs
It processes jobs as they arrive in the queue
You don't need to explicitly "consume" the worker anywhere else - the Docker container keeps it running continuously in the background, processing jobs from the Redis queue. This is why it's called a "background worker service" in the comments

# 1. First connect to Redis CLI

docker exec -it redis redis-cli

# 2. Once inside Redis CLI, try these commands to see the data:

HGETALL bull:notifications:1 # Get data for job ID 1
HGETALL bull:notifications:2 # Get data for job ID 2
HGETALL bull:notifications:3
